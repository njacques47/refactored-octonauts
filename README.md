# Code Refactor Starter Code

## User Story
AS A marketing agency </br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards </br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Changes Made
The appropriate semantic HTML was added to denote the header and footer elements. All images now have an empty alt tag to denote that the image is not informational and should not be read by screen readers. I also changed the classes and removed the IDs because they were repetitive. The stylesheet was updated accordingly to reflect those changes and condense the styling that was repeated.
